# Proof of Response Protocol Integration Plan

## Overview
The Proof of Response (PoR) protocol enables verifiable request/response interactions between network participants, where either:
- The requestor receives a response
- The requestor receives proof that a node failed to respond (and that node is penalized)

## Core Components
1. Smart Contract
   - Orchestrates network topology (graph of nodes)
   - Handles staking and penalties
   - Manages state channels between nodes
   - Handles edge breaking/timeout enforcement

2. Network Protocol Layer
   - Message passing between nodes
   - Path selection through the network
   - Response verification
   - Edge capacity monitoring and management
   - Timeout/latency tracking
   - Payment channel operations

## Integration Points
To integrate PoR into nearcore, we need to:

1. **Core Protocol Layer** (`chain/network`)
   - The PoR protocol should be implemented as a new protocol type within NEAR's networking layer
   - Primary components:
     - Message types for requests, responses, and proofs
     - Path selection and routing logic
     - Timeout and latency monitoring
     - Edge capacity management
     - State channel integration

2. **Smart Contract Layer**
   - New system contract for PoR (`core/contracts`)
   - Responsibilities:
     - Maintain network topology (graph state)
     - Handle staking and slashing
     - Process edge creation/removal
     - Manage state channels between nodes
     - Handle dispute resolution

3. **Client Integration** (`core/client`)
   - Extend the NEAR client to support PoR operations
   - Add APIs for:
     - Submitting requests through the network
     - Managing node participation in the PoR network
     - Monitoring edge status and network health

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Core Protocol**
   - Create new protocol types and messages
   - Implement basic request/response flow
   - Add path selection and routing
   - Set up timeout monitoring

2. **Phase 2: Smart Contract**
   - Develop graph state management
   - Implement staking mechanisms
   - Add edge management
   - Create state channel infrastructure

3. **Phase 3: Integration**
   - Connect protocol to smart contract
   - Add client APIs
   - Implement node participation logic
   - Add monitoring and metrics

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle state channel implementation?
   - Consider existing state channel frameworks
   - Evaluate custom implementation for PoR needs
   - Determine integration with NEAR's native token

2. What's the optimal strategy for path selection?
   - Balance between latency and cost
   - Consider network topology
   - Handle network partitions

3. How do we ensure efficient edge capacity management?
   - Monitor bandwidth utilization
   - Handle congestion gracefully
   - Implement fair pricing mechanisms
